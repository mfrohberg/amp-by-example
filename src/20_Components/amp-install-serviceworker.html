  #### Introduction

  The [amp-install-serviceworker](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions%2Famp-install-serviceworker%2Famp-install-serviceworker.md)
  component enables service worker installation via original and cached AMP pages.
  
  [Service workers](https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/blob/master/explainer.md) can run in the background even when the browser is closed, cache required contents in advance of rendering time and send notifications to users and more.
  This sample installs a service worker which caches this page in the background. You can test this by loading this page while offline once the service worker has been installed.

  Service Workers are currently available in [Chrome, Firefox and Opera](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/).

  <!-- #### Installing the Service Worker -->
  <!--
  `amp-install-serviceworker` should have both properties `src` and `data-iframe-src` set; `src` is the location of service worker to be installed when the original AMP pages is accessed, `data-iframe-src` is the location of HTML file which calls service worker installation process when the cached AMP pages is accessed.
  The reason why the latter option is required is because browsers can't install service worker from other domains for security reasons. For details of the security considerations of service worker, [see official specs](https://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/#security-considerations).
  -->
  <amp-install-serviceworker
      src="/sw.js"
      data-iframe-src="https://ampbyexample.com/sw.html"
      layout="nodisplay">
  </amp-install-serviceworker>
  <!--
  <p class="card warning">The service worker in this sample ([sw.js](https://ampbyexample.com/sw.js)) is generated using [sw-precache](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache). With sw-precache you can generate service worker code that will precache specific resources.</p> 
  
  In this sample, when users access this AMP page for the 2nd time, the service worker is installed and start caching all image files and video files under root path of this domain.
  
  In order to confirm if the service worker is installed and it is working as expected, follow the procedure below:
  1. Access to https://ampbyexample.com/components/amp-install-serviceworker/ twice.
  2. Open Chrome Dev Tools and navigate to "Resources" tab. In the "Service Workers" section you can see that `/sw.js` is installed.
  3. Then open "Cached Storage". You'll find a lot of files whose names start with `sw-precache-v1--`, these are the cached images and videos.
  4. Disable your network connection and reload this page. It still works! In the "Network" tab in Dev Tools, you'll find see which resources are cached by the service worker.
